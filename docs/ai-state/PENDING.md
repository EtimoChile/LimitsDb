# Open pending items

Compact queue. Each pending item must identify an owner artifact and a next
action. When resolved, remove it from this table and record any durable
decision that resulted in `DECISIONS.md`.

Allowed states: `OPEN`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DEFERRED`, and `FUTURE`.

No concurrency/state pending item remains (PEND-022 to PEND-027 are implemented). The design is
described in `docs/concurrency-control.md`, which must be kept in sync with the implementation.

| ID | Status | Scope | Pending | Owner artifact | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
