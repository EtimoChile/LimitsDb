# Open pending items

Compact queue. Each pending item must identify an owner artifact and a next
action. When resolved, remove it from this table and record any durable
decision that resulted in `DECISIONS.md`.

Allowed states: `OPEN`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DEFERRED`, and `FUTURE`.

No concurrency/state pending item remains (PEND-022 to PEND-027 are implemented). The design is
described in `docs/concurrency-control.md`, which must be kept in sync with the implementation.

| ID | Status | Scope | Pending | Owner artifact | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PEND-028 | FUTURE | ILM/history | By design history tables carry only their primary key (extra indexes slow the ILM and history is not queried like production), so source indexes are not propagated. A setting for special history indexes may be added: per-table index list, and how the runtime user creates them (`INDEX` privilege creates the index in the grantee's schema; otherwise admin credentials or the DBA file). The drop of indexes outside the primary key is controlled by `history_drop_unmanaged_indexes` (default `true`). | `limitsdb/core/ldb_runner.py`; `limitsdb/db/oracle/ldb_engine_impl.py` | Design the setting when a use case appears. |
